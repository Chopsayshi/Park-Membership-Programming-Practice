## Park Membership Program - AKA First C Attempt
Welcome, this is a practice program with the aim of figuring out the fundamentals of C. Instead of your 
classic 'Hello World!', I will be using some prior python knowlege to head right into the depths of something a bit more complex. 

As it is C I plan on having the program get/send members to and from a txt file.
Plus as everything happens within a cmd window I shall play around with some custom ascii art.

### To Do:
The following things are features I intend to add which should allow me to practice a wide range of 
different C functions.
- Main menu
    - Stats: numMembers
    - Select an option: Add, Delete, Update, Print
- Add Member
    - firstName, lastName, dob, dateAdded, membershipType
- Delete Member
    - deleteMember should ask the user if they are sure then delete the members details if they say yes.
- Update Member
    - update = firstName, lastName, dob, dateAdded, membershipType
